* Algorithms and Data Structure 

Repository contains implementation of basic algorithms and data structures in Javascript(ES6).

Babel to transpile the code to JS
Jest to unit test the code implementation

Each algorithm and data structure contains a README file that explains general attributes of the algorithms and datastructure followed by the implementation and the algorithmic complexity and the general use cases for them.

Asymptotic notation:


Divide and conquer method:

* Strassenâ€™s surprising method for multiplying two square matrices

* Recurrences

* Probabilistic analysis and randomization algorithms


algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes
some value, or set of values, as input and produces some value, or set of values, as
output


Input instance -> Algorithms(set of instructions) -> Correct Output instance



Concerns of Software Engineering discipline:
* data abstraction
* modularity
* error handling
